## Project 3

In this project, we'll use both ends of the Particle event system - publishing and subscribing - in order to build devices which talk to each other.

#### Requirements

This project includes using multiple devices, so you'll need to grab a partner or two. You'll also need to pull in the Neopixel library again like in Project 2.

#### Key Concepts/Components

- **Particle.subscribe:** Subscribe to Particle events. You must pass in the name of the event, and a function to run when the event is published elsewhere.

#### Component Layout
