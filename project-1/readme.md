## Project 1 - Simple Components

In this project we'll use the Particle Photon, a button, and an LED.

#### Key Concepts/Components
- **void setup():** all Arduino code must have a setup function defined. This gets run once when the system boots up.

- **void loop():** all Arduino code must also have a loop function defined. After setup is run, this runs as in an infinite loop.

- **pinMode:** tells the device that we'll be using a pin to either gather `INPUT` or provide `OUTPUT`.

- **digitalRead:** takes a digital (HIGH or LOW) reading from the specified pin. This will return `HIGH` or `LOW`.

- **digitalWrite:** writes out a digital signal to the specified pin.
