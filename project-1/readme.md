## Project 1 - Simple Components

In this project we'll use the Particle Photon, a button, and an LED.

#### Key Concepts/Components
- **digitalRead:** takes a digital (HIGH or LOW) reading from the specified pin. This will return `HIGH` or `LOW`.

#### Component Layout

#### Challenges

Finish this up with some time to spare? Give this a shot:

- Cause your light to blink a few times whenever you press the button.
- Cause your light to turn on after you've released the button, and for the amount of time that you held down the button.
  - Note: this one might be tough because of [switch bouncing](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/switch-bounce-how-to-deal-with-it/).
