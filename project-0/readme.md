## Project 0 - Hello World

Let's get our bearings! We're going to:
- Learn how to navigate and use the Particle online IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
- What is a breadboard?
- Walk through how a typical .ino file works
- Run the "Hello World" project of hardware

#### Key Concepts/Components
- **void setup():** all Arduino code must have a setup function defined. This gets run once when the system boots up.

- **void loop():** all Arduino code must also have a loop function defined. After setup is run, this runs as in an infinite loop.

- **pinMode:** tells the device that we'll be using a pin to either gather `INPUT` or provide `OUTPUT`.

- **digitalWrite:** writes out a digital signal to the specified pin.
